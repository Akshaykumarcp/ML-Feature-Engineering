Feature Engineering techniques for Machine Learning

One reason for success of a ML project is coming up with a good set of features to train on. 

The process of obtaining a good set of features is called as feature engineering.

Feature engineering involves:

1. Feature Extraction: Combine existing features to produce a more usefull features.
2. Feature Selection: Select the best features to train an ML system.
