# 1. What is feature engineering ?

- One reason for success of a ML project is coming up with a good set of features to train on. 
- The process of obtaining a good set of features is called as feature engineering.

# 2. What happens when feature engineering is done ?

- Improve performance of machine learning model
- Feature engineering represents data 

Feature engineering involves:

1. Feature Extraction: Combine existing features to produce a more usefull features.
2. Feature Selection: Select the best features to train an ML system.
