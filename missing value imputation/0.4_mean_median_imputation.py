when should we use mean or median imputation ? 

# mean or median can be used when feature/column/variable data distribution is normal distribution

# median should be used when feature/column/variable data distribution is left skewed or right skewed

what are the Limitations of mean or median imputation:

- Distoration of original feature/column/variable distribution 
- Distoration of original feature/column/variable variance
- Distoration of covariance with remaining feature/column/variable of the dataset
- Higher the percentage of NA, higher the distortions
